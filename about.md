### So who am I?

<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/me.png" class="profile-pic" style="float: right;">

My name is Jesper L Pedersen, and I'm currently studying Web Development at the [Linneuas University][linneaus university], Sweden. 
The current program involves learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, UML, design patterns, ASP.NET MVC, php, Node.js, scrum, REST, JSON, XML 
and more. Currently living in Gothenburg, Sweden. Love the city, and love how Gothenburg is right inbetween 
the small village and the metropolis.

I'm a curious and a fast learning, hard working student, who loves being creative with programming. Other than that, I've got a 
long experience in the service-business, and are aiming to bring that with me when doing user friendly applications.
