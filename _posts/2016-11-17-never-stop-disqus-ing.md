It's always nice to have a way to communicate, whether it is in real life or on the web. But how do you implement communication on 
for example a blog page? With comments and online discussions of course! Being able to comment on blog posts or other pages is preferred by many, 
and is almost a standard when it comes to blogging. 

### But how do I make it available?
There are lots of ways you can do it. Either create a whole chat-script for yourself, or use one of the many available 
comments-software that is offered on the web. In this web page, I use [Disqus][disqus] as an add on, to make comments available.
It's pretty easy to configure; follow the guidelines on the disqus-webpage, copy and paste the intended script, and place it where 
you'd like your comments to pop up. For this website, i've placed the script for comments in this border, so that you can easily see
that this post goes with the comments.
