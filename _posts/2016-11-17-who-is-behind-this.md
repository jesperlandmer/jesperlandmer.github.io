So who is behind this web page? And how do I find out? Through the humans.txt-document of course. The humans.txt is a way to 
find out more about a web page and the people behind it, the software it's using, the company etc. By creating a txt-document you create an easy, simple and 
accessible way to find out whose behind the website, without any fuss or risk of interference with efficiency. 

### What should you mention?

Anything you want! The authors, copywriters, SEO-managers or whoever you want to mention. 

### Is it standard?
There are currently no standards in the author-documentation-field, but many people aim to make humans.txt as standard as possible.
There are other ways of proving authorship as well, for example creating author META-tags.

### How is it configured?
The txt-document is located at the root directory. For this website, I've mentioned my self as the author, contact information, 
date and language, standards and components.
